    application-specific text-parsing plugins MUST be updated.
  - Text-parsing plugins that produce region information must do so with the new
    CueRegion class.  Any application-specific text-parsing plugins that produce
    region information MUST be updated.
  - TextDisplayer plugins that handle region information must do so with the new
    CueRegion interface.  Any application-specific TextDisplayer plugins that
    handle region information MUST be updated.

    use certain PresentationTimeline methods MUST be updated:
    - `setAvailabilityStart()` was renamed to `setUserSeekStart()`.

      `isFirstPeriod`, instead of a period start time and a reference array.
